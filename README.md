# Work-Day Scheduler

A tool for someone to use to keep track of meetings, assignments, etc. from hour to hour throughout the day. Using day.js, it keeps track of the exact time, and allows the user to input whatever pertinent data they want the app to keep track of, which it does in local storage.
